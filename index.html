						<p class="title1"> Hong Kong Disneyland. This the place to be for adults and children alike if you love adventure, Disney fan or not! Due to its compact size, it is easy to cover the park in a day's time. Apart from the rides, my personal favourite was the mini Lion King musical performance, perfect for a rainy day when most rides are suspended!</p>

Hiring a driver or renting a car are not too expensive here, and it allows you to drive through villages, under lush trees and past breezy beaches. Since the Goa city centre is relatively small, this is a perfect idea for a relaxed holiday.  </p>
